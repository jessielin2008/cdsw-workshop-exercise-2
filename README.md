2. Create a Scala Session and run machine-learning.scala
3. Stop both the Python and Scala sessions.
3. Review cleanup.scala but do not execute it.

## Notes

1. Raw stats are in /data
2. data-processing.scala --> data transformations + table creations
3. analysis.py --> ad-hoc analysis with pandas
4. machine-learning.scala --> Regression analysis with spark mllib
